# Radix-Sort-Code
The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.
#Explanation
Original, unsorted list:
170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66

Sorting by least significant digit (1s place) gives: 
[*Notice that we keep 802 before 2, because 802 occurred 
before 2 in the original list, and similarly for pairs 
170 & 90 and 45 & 75.]

170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66

Sorting by next digit (10s place) gives: 
[*Notice that 802 again comes before 2 as 802 comes before 
2 in the previous list.]

802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90

Sorting by the most significant digit (100s place) gives:
2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802
